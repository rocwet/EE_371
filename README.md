# Project 1
The purpose of the project is to review our knowledge of Verilog and get familiar using
old and new tools to model, synthesize, and test hardware. Finally, we will write a C
program to have a basic introduction to the C programming language.

### Contents
In our project we will implement a 4-bit down counter in Verilog in four ways:
1.  Structurally
2.  Dataflow
3.  Johnson implementation (http://electronics-course.com/johnson-counter)
4.  Structurally

Finally, we will also write a C program that behaves like a calculator.
