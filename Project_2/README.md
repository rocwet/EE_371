## Specification
* On Arrival
  * Bathysphere must signal the docking port 5 minutes before arrival
  * If interlock chamber is empty, the signal from the bathysphere should cause inner and outer ports of the interlock to be closed and sealed
  * After ports are closed a sealed, chamber is filled and pressured to a pressure difference between the chamber interior and the outside of the port to less than 0.1 atm.
  * When the pressure difference between the inside and exterior of the chamber reaches less than 0.1, the outer port shall be opened. Filling and pressurizing the chamber takes 7 minutes.
* On Departure


Finally, we will also write a C program that converts currency.
